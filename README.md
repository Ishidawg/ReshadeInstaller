*This project started as a university project, and I already mentioned that in the [old readme file](https://github.com/Ishidawg/LeShade/blob/main/OLD-README.md). The project grew and became a passion project, and now I think it's good to have a new readme file.*

LeShade is a reshade manager for linux, thinks of a mod manager, but specifically for reshade. It include features like:
- Common APIs support *(DX9, DX10, DX11, DX1/Vulkan, OpenGL)*
- Direct3D 8.x support
- ReShade with **addon** and **non-addon** versions
- ReShade with release versions support
- Uninstall ReShade per game basis from previous installations
- Many shaders repositories

## Usage
The program it self is very intuitive, so if you already used a mod manager or even the reshade installer *"à la"* Wizard you will no likely not have any problems. Even though I have made a [video guide](https://youtu.be/ge8558huYfE). You can download the AppImage or Flatpak version on [release page](https://github.com/Ishidawg/LeShade/releases).

**AppImage Instructions:**
1. Select `LeShade-x86_64.AppImage` that you have download
2. Right click > Properties > Permissions > **Check: Allow executing file as program** _(or likely)_
3. Done!

**Flatpak Instructions:**
1. Open the terminal
2. Go to the folder that you have downloaded LeShade (eg: `cd ~/Downloads`)
3. Execute on terminal: `flatpak install ./LeShade-x86_64-x86_64.flatpak`
4. Done!

**Direct3D 8.0 instructions:**
If you are installing ReShade on game that uses Direct3D 8.0, you **must** add the environment variables on your game launcher *(Steam, Heroic Games Lancher, Lutris, Faugus Launcher)*. Here are two examples of how you can do to set those on Steam and Heroic.

## Development
LeShade is built with PySide6 with default Qt widgets, so you can expect a **seamless theme integration with your system**. Qt was my choice to build the GUI because I've seen other awesome applications that uses it and I really like: *PCSX2, Duckstation and ShadPS4*. Also,  LeShade was developed exclusive by human hands, without any sort of AI bullshit.

I have tested each build *(AppImage and Flatpak)* on *Oracle Virtual* with those 3 distros: *Ubuntu 25.10, Ubuntu 24.04.3, Linux Mint 22.2*. Also, have tested on *CachyOS non-vm*. You can take a look into this [pull resquest](https://github.com/Ishidawg/LeShade/pull/9).
The logo was made by me on *Inkscape*.
